## Understanding brief
Thursday 11:00 - 11:20. 
I will focus first on building the UI components that ionic doesn't have. I want to keep state and other business logic out of my UI components. 
My approach will be to sketch something out in Figma to make it easier to identify what I need to build and where I want to add it to the page.
Then I want to go from bottom up, adding a skeleton component and immediately linking it to a story and a unit test. After I've done this same approach
with all the components I need to build myself, I will focus on switching users and adding the items to the page.

## Ionic docs and project setup
Thursday 11:20 - 12:00
I've followed the guide on how to set up a project with ionic+react. I've briefly gone over the components they offer. I noticed there is theming, 
I want to go for a light theme. I'll have to research further on how to adjust the theme with my own colors. 
I want to go over the other docs they have later.
